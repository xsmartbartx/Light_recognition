# Light Recognition

A Python script for detecting light conditions using computer vision and image processing.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository implements a light detection system using Python. The core script analyzes images to recognize and respond to light patterns or intensity. It can serve as a foundation for vision-based automation or sensing tasks.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time light detection logic
- Lightweight Python-based implementation
- Useful for robotics, smart sensing, or environmental light analysis
- Designed for extension with additional models or sensors

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `AI wykrywanie swiatel.py` – main script implementing light detection logic.
- `.gitignore` – ignored files for Git.
- `LICENSE` – project license (MIT).
- `README.md` – this documentation file.

## 🛠 Requirements

Install dependencies (Python 3.8+ recommended):

---

## ▶️ Usage

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/xsmartbartx/Light_recognition.git
cd Light_recognition


Run the main script:

python "AI wykrywanie swiatel.py"

---

## 📌 Configuration

Edit or extend the script to integrate with:

Webcam or camera streams

Image directories

External triggers based on detected light thresholds

---

## 🧪 Notes & Customization

You can integrate this project with robotics frameworks (e.g., ROS) or automation tools.

Add modular detectors (e.g., deep learning models) for advanced light pattern recognition.
